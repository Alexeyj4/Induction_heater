<span class="redhead">PCB Design Project—Dual XM5516, Blade Processor (Telecom), Avago/LSI</span>
<div style="padding:12px;">
	This 18-layer board features two 1680-pin BGA's (XM5516) with massive 
vapor-tube heatsinks, four 9-chip DDR3 banks, multiple communications 
	channels (USB, Ethernet) over a dozen 10GHz transmission lines and 
several hi-current switching power supplies. The 10GHz lines required 
	extremely tight length matching (+/-&nbsp;2&nbsp;mils) and separation. 
Each of the DDR banks required significant length matching 
	(+/-&nbsp;20mils) that included the skews internal to each of the 
XM5516's. To maintain impedance control and circuit isolation as well as
 
	route this extremely dense design, blind vias were used extensively and
 the PCB was structured as essentially two 9-layer boards sandwiched 
	together. This was undoubtedly my most challenging design.<br><br>

<span class="redhead">PCB Design Project—SPARTAN 6 LX150T DEVELOPMENT BOARD, Avnet Electronics Marketing</span>
<div style="padding:12px;">
	This 12 layer board (6-signal, 6-plane), designed from Avnet's 
schematics, features a Spartan 6 FPGA (BGA 676) with DDR3 memory, 
	SFP, SATA, USB2.0, SD and RS232 interfaces, 10/100/1000 Ethernet PHY, 
and 2 FMC LPC Expansion slots in a PCIe X4 form factor. The 
	challenges of this design were: 10 power rails requiring heavily split 
planes on the inner most layers (flanked by solid GND 
	planes), several hi-speed interfaces requiring extensive length 
matching and a single-channel DDR3 memory. The unique FPGA 
	pin-swapping and length tuning capability of Altium Designer simplified
 routing of this board.<br><br>

<span class="redhead">PCB Design Project, Multi-Board—MAPPS, POWER SUPPLY/CHARGING SYSTEM (Military), Physical Optics Inc.</span>
<div style="padding:12px;"> 
	This 5-board assembly was designed from supplied schematics. The 2 
boards on each end are simple, 4-layer interconnects. The 3 center 
	boards are 4, 4, and 6 layers with components on both sides. The 
challenges for these boards were: hi-current conductors with 
	delicate switching power supplies and the obvious mechanical 
constraints. All 5 boards were completed in 7 days. The 3D capabilities 
of Altium Designer were key to the 
	successful completion of this project.<br><br>

<div style="padding:12px;"> 
	MIDS redesigned this product for Induction Innovations turning an ugly,
 difficult to hold and use "caulking tube" into a new, 
	ergonomic, device. We converted a thru-hole PCB to SMT and redsigned 
the housing. This rather simple-looking 2-layer board posed a 
	significant challenge due to the the nature of the circuit, a 
hi-voltage/current inductive-heating control system, and the necessity 
	to fit everything inside the handle of a sleek new housing and maintain
 sufficient airflow to cool the circuitry. The mechcanical 
	design was performed using ProE (Parametric Technologies). The 
electro-mechanical integration issues were mitigated by 
	Altium Designer's 3D capabilitites.<br><br>

<span class="redhead">PCB Design Project—XVPX-6300 "Archer" Embedded Processor Module (Computer Systems), Xembedded Inc.</span>
<div style="padding:12px;"> 
	This 18-layer board, designed from schematics supplied by Xembedded, 
sports an Intel I-7 (Processor), an Intel QM57 (PCH), an 
	array of 9 DDR3 chips and several other BGAs in a '3U-VPX' form factor.
 The challenges were many: hi-speed interfaces requiring 
	significant length matching, impedance control, multiple differential 
pairs, 2-sided parts placement and very high pin-density. 
	Blind and buried vias were used throughout to achieve routability and 
meet SI criteria.<br><br>

<div style="padding:12px;"> 
	The 4 boards in this project, designed from supplied schematics, all 
fit inside of and control a very small 'Robot' used by the 
	police and the military for reconnaissance. The boards, 4 and 6-layer, 
feature video, RF and IR sensors as well as 
	control modules to move the robot and communicate with a handheld 
Command Center. The design challenges were: the extreme 
	small size and mechanical constraints as well as the variety of 
circuitry including digital, analog and RF.<br><br>

<span class="redhead">PCB Design Project—Flight Processor Board (Avionics), L3 Communications-Cincinnati Electric</span>
<div style="padding:12px;"> 
	This 16-layer, Commercial and Military Avionics board was designed from
 L-3 supplied schematics. It features a SPARC processor, 
	an Actel ProASIC FPGA, multiple memory and interface options as well as
 several hi-speed interfaces in a cPCI-6U form factor. 
	The design challenges were: several hi-speed interfaces and 
Differential Pairs requiring length matching and impedance controlled 
	routing and several switching power supplies. The unique FPGA 
pin-swapping capability of Altium Designer simplified routing of 
	this board.
